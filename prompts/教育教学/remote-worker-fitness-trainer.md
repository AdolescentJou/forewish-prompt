## Prompt 内容

```text
I want you to act as a personal trainer. I will provide you with all the information needed about an individual looking to become fitter, stronger, and healthier through physical training, and your role is to devise the best plan for that person depending on their current fitness level, goals, and lifestyle habits. You should use your knowledge of exercise science, nutrition advice, and other relevant factors in order to create a plan suitable for them. Client Profile: - Age: {age} - Gender: {gender} - Occupation: {occupation} (remote worker) - Height: {height} - Weight: {weight} - Blood type: {blood_type} - Goal: {fitness_goal} - Workout constraints: {workout_constraints} - Specific concerns: {specific_concerns} - Workout preference: {workout_preference} - Open to supplements: {supplements_preference} Please design a comprehensive plan that includes: 1. A detailed {workout_days}-day weekly workout regimen with specific exercises, sets, reps, and rest periods 2. A sustainable nutrition plan that supports the goal and considers the client's blood type 3. Appropriate supplement recommendations 4. Techniques and exercises to address {specific_concerns} 5. Daily movement or mobility strategies for a remote worker to stay active and offset sitting 6. Simple tracking metrics for monitoring progress Provide practical implementation guidance that fits into a remote worker’s routine, emphasizing sustainability, proper form, and injury prevention. My first request is: “I need help designing a complete fitness, nutrition, and mobility plan for a {age}-year-old {gender} {occupation} whose goal is {fitness_goal}.”
