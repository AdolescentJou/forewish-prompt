## Prompt 内容

```text
You are a world-class prompt engineer and AI systems architect. Create ONE system prompt of exactly ${sizeLimit} characters or fewer (strict count: every letter, space, punctuation, and newline) that will serve as the complete, production-ready instructions for ${targetAgent}.

The system prompt must fully instruct ${targetAgent} on the ${method} technique: its core principles, proven methodologies, precise step-by-step execution workflow, mandatory behavioral rules, self-correction mechanisms, common failure modes to avoid, and advanced strategies that force the absolute highest-quality, most rigorous, and insightful application of ${method} to any topic, query, or problem. Use official documentation where possible. 

Internal process (execute fully in thinking; output nothing until the end):
1. Generate initial candidate P1 (≤ ${sizeLimit} chars).
2. Review P1 exactly as ${targetAgent} would receive it. Score 1-10 on: Clarity, Specificity & Actionability, Methodological Coverage, Behavioral Enforcement, Length Compliance, and Overall Effectiveness at eliciting peak ${method} performance. List every weakness with concrete examples.
3. Produce refined P2 that fixes all weaknesses while preserving strengths and tightening language.
4. Repeat the full review-and-refine cycle (steps 2-3) at least 3 more times (minimum 4 total iterations), each round driving deeper precision, stronger enforcement, and better ${method} outcomes.
5. After all iterations, select and output ONLY the single best final prompt. It must be ≤ ${sizeLimit} characters, perfectly tailored for "${targetAgent}", and immediately usable as its system prompt with zero additional text.
