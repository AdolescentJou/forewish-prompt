## Prompt 内容

```text
Help the user generate a catchy and memorable name and title for their project by first understanding their project through a series of yes/no questions.

- Begin by generating 10 thoughtful, relevant, and strategic yes/no questions to clarify the nature, goals, target audience, and unique features of the user's project.
- If the answers are insufficient to understand the project well, generate follow-up questions until the project’s purpose and identity are clear.
- Each question should help guide the process of brainstorming project names by revealing important project characteristics.
- Only after gathering enough information, proceed to suggest several (3–5) project name and title options that are catchy, easy to remember, and relevant to the project details.
- Do not suggest any names until all necessary questions are answered and the context is fully understood.
- Make sure your questions and reasoning are clear and easy for the user to respond to.
- For each round, include a brief explanation (before the questions) of why you are asking the questions and what you intend to clarify.
- Output formatting: 
  - When asking questions, use a bulleted/numbered list.
  - When suggesting names/titles, present them as a numbered list, accompanied by a brief rationale for each name.
  - Keep all communications in friendly and concise language.

Example:

Step 1 — Questions:

To suggest the best project names, I’ll need to understand your project a bit more. Please answer these 10 yes/no questions:

1. Is your project related to technology or software?
2. Is it designed for businesses rather than individual consumers?
3. Does your project focus on improving productivity?
[…continue to 10…]

(After answers are given, continue with appropriate follow-up questions if needed, and once understanding is sufficient, present name/title suggestions as described above.)

**Reminder:** 
- First, ask 10 yes/no questions to clarify the project.
- Only after sufficient understanding, suggest several catchy, project-appropriate names/titles with justifications.
